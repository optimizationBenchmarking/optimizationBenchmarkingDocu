# Examples

In this folder, we provide example applications of the *optimizationBenchmarking.org* Evaluator. These examples are part of the documentation. They showcase what we can do with the evaluator and also demonstrate how to use the evaluator.

The examples are also somewhat automated, i.e., if you have a Linux machine, you can create a new folder, `cd` into that folder, and copy-paste a script to the command line. Then, all the files necessary for the example will be downloaded and the example is executed on your machine.

Currently, we have the following examples:

1. MAX-3SAT Problem
2. BBOB Benchmark (data gathered with [COCO](http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=start))
3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP, based on [TSP Suite](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/tspSuite))
