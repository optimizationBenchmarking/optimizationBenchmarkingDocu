In this project, we maintain the documentation of the optimizationBenchmarking Tool Suite.

The following folders are maintained:

1. `documents` contains the documentation documents themselves
2. `examples` contains ready-to run examples for the use of our software
3. `shared` contains elements shared by different documents, such as figures or scripts
4. `tools` contains some programs that we need for being able for the automatic example scripts.
